Facial Emotion Recognition
Deep Learning
Computer Vision
Emotion Classification
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
OpenCV
Python

**Techniques Used:**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): We use CNNs to process and extract features from facial images. These deep learning models have proven effective in image classification tasks.

Emotion Classification: The system is trained to recognize several basic emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral. We employ a multi-class classification approach.

OpenCV Integration: OpenCV is used for capturing and preprocessing video frames, enabling efficient face detection and alignment for input into the emotion recognition model.

Data Augmentation: To improve model robustness, data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and brightness adjustment are applied during training.

Model Evaluation: We provide comprehensive model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and F1-scores to assess the system's performance.
